# Setup

As the first of the demos, a bit of setup is required here.

* You need a server (your laptop, a virtual server in AWS or Digital Ocean)
* Install Python and all depencies
* Maybe you are excited, but take a little time to set yourself up for success before you continue forward
  * How will you organize your changes?
  * What editor will you use?
  * What are natural stopping points for you?
  
  
## Python Setup

These setup commands will be helpful.  These particular examples were built on Mac OSX with Python 3.6
* ```pip3 install --upgrade pip``` to upgrade your version of pip.
* ```pip3 install cookiecutter -U --user``` to add the package dependency manager used in this course
* ```et-Help <cmdlet namGe>``` more commands.



If you are using Anaconda, this is an easy way to start your project in a conda virtual environment:

```server:talkpython phil$ conda create --name talkpython1 pyramid
